# Reference
 * Important React Concepts
    * [Render Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html)
        * >Instead of hard-coding one component inside another in order to share a state, we can provide the component with a "render prop", or a FUNCTION prop that it uses to dynamically determine waht to render.
    * [Hooks] (https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
        * Trying to solve the React problem of needing to "attach" reusable behavior to a component, such as connecting it to a store or passing on a state as with **render props** or **higher order components**.
        * Universal state 
        * **NO LONGER NEED TO USE CLASSES...**
    * [Function Components] (https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
        * Used to be called stateless components but with the advent of **Hooks**, we can now merely use function components every where we go!
